# Challenge: Create a react app that will use any of the public APIs listed [here](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis). Use Bootstrap 4.

I think I want to create an app that will use an API to displays the weather, which corresponds to a particular playlist. User input will be the name of the city, then the API will display the weather conditions.
